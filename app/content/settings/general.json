  "productDescription": "QUALITY FIRST\r\n\r\nLIFE IN BALANCE. At Zinzino, we provide best-in-class, cutting edge and tailor-made products within the new science of pharmaconutrition, which uses active nutrients from food to fight the imbalance in our modern lifestyle.\n\nOur lead concept is Balance. Science’s new look at Balance involves the ratio of Omega-6 to Omega-3 essential fatty acids. Both are essential and vital to several functions in our bodies. The problem is the imbalance between these fatty acids created by changes in our diet in our modern world. \n\nToo much dietary Omega-6 in your body creates imbalance. A low intake of the essential Omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA creates imbalance.
