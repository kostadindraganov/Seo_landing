  "productDescription": "Key benefits\r\nSynergistic formula that contributes to normal heart2, brain1 and immune3 function\r\nHelps maintain good levels of EPA and DHA in your body4\r\nHelps maintain optimal Omega-6:3 levels in your body4\r\nHelps maintain polyphenol levels in your body to support blood lipids from oxidative stress5\r\nSupports healthy and normal eye function since it contains 700 mg DHA7\r\nSupports normal blood triglyceride levels8, normal blood pressure9 and normal blood calcium levels10\r\nContributes to normal bones11, muscle function12, normal teeth13 and cell division14 since the daily dosage contains 20 μg Vitamin D3\r\nBalanceOil+ is made only from ingredients coming from natural sources. \nMore information\r\nFish oil \r\nThe fish oils used in BalanceOil+ products have a strict specification for EPA and DHA that efficiently optimises the Omega-6:3 fatty acid balance in the body within 120 days. The fish oils we use are primarily derived from short-lived, small pelagic fish such as sardines and anchovies. The fish oils are derived from whole, unprocessed fish. The oil goes through a refining process to remove environmental contaminants (if any is present) and is certified as free from heavy metals and other toxins. LYSI, the manufacturer of BalanceOil+, meets all regulatory requirements for production, and follows GMPs (Good Manufacturing Practices) for food and pharmaceutical products.\r\n\r\nExtra virgin olive oil\r\nThe Spanish Picual olive is selected due to its richness in Omega-9 and very high antioxidant content. The olives are of pre-harvest quality and in the process the stones are taken out and only the fruits are cold-pressed, resulting in an extra virgin oil, rich in Omega-9 (Oleic acid) with very high content of antioxidants called polyphenols (above 750 mg/kg5), both with several beneficial effects. The polyphenols protect the BalanceOil+ in the bottle but even more importantly, also your cells.6\r\n\r\nVitamin D3 \r\nBalanceOil+ contains vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). We use a natural vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) made from lanolin. Lanolin is a naturally occurring fat found in sheep’s wool. The vitamin D is made by dissolving a precursor to vitamin D from the lanolin. It is then chemically altered and activated by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. The chemical process is comparable to the process which occurs in the human skin when it produces vitamin D.\r\n\r\nNatural tocopherols\r\nMixed tocopherols is are commonly used anti-oxidant in dietary supplements. The natural tocopherols used are made from GMO-free, highly refined soybean oil distillates, which undergo further refining and therefore do not contain any soy proteins. This means there are no allergens present. The typical composition is: alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-tocopherols.\r\n\r\nFish and olive oil synergy = results\r\nOur scientists formulated BalanceOil+ to combine the Omega-3 with the correct amounts of olive oil that provides Omega-9 and anti-oxidants in extra high amounts. This synergistic combination makes it possible to safely adjust and maintain the Omega-3 in your body to achieve an Omega-6:3 Balance below 3:1.\r\n\r\nProof of balance in 120 days\r\nOur certified laboratories are responsible for analysing the dried blood spot tests for eleven fatty acids in the blood, making our database the worlds largest of its kind. The average Omega-6:3 ratio for people not taking an Omega-3 supplement is 12:1 for Northern Europe, 15:1 for Europe and 25:1 for USA. After taking BalanceOi+ for 120 days, the average ratio is for most people below 3:1.",
